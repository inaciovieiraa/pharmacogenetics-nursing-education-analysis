This project aims to assess Nursing students' knowledge regarding pharmacogenetics and measure the impact of an educational intervention based on clinical data.

## Objective
To identify and analyze, through data, gaps in academic training regarding genetics and pharmacogenetics, and to evaluate whether an educational intervention improves students' understanding and perception of the clinical application of this knowledge.

## The Problem (Based on Scientific Literature)
Recent studies indicate that nurses demonstrate low confidence in interpreting genetic tests and applying pharmacogenetics in clinical practice. Traditional academic training still offers little preparation for this knowledge, which is essential for precision medicine, potentially impacting patient safety and clinical decision-making.

## Tech Stack (Planned)
This project was designed to use a data-driven approach. The following tools will be implemented in the next stages:

* **Data Collection:** Google Forms (Structured questionnaires for Module 1 and 3 of the Genetics course for Nursing students at the Federal University of Minas Gerais - UFMG).
* **Initial Processing:** Excel (Database structuring and cleaning).
* **Future Implementations:** Python (Pandas/Matplotlib libraries) for advanced statistical analysis, chart automation, and learning variation (Delta) calculation after data collection.

## Methodology
The project follows an educational data analysis approach, consisting of the following steps:

1.  **Literature Review:** Literature analysis to identify competence gaps in genetics and pharmacogenetics in Nursing.
2.  **Data Collection (Baseline):** Application of a structured questionnaire before the educational intervention (end of Module 1 of the "Fundamentals of Genetics and Evolution" course).
3.  **Intervention:** Conducting a Discussion Group (DG) at the end of the course (Module 3), based on scientific articles, addressing pharmacogenetics knowledge, patient safety, and clinical decision-making.
4.  **New Data Collection:** Application of a new questionnaire after the educational intervention.
5.  **Impact Analysis:** Comparison of pre- and post-intervention data using data analysis and descriptive statistics to assess changes in students' knowledge and perception of essential precision medicine concepts.
